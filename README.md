## Hi, my name is Stathis 👋

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Informatics at the University of Piraeus, specializing in Software Technologies and Intelligent Systems.

I'm have recently started engaging with ASP.NET MVC and web development.  
I have worked on small projects using Java and Android Studio.
I also have some basic knowledge of Python and SQL.

I'm interested in improving my skills, learning new technologies, and working both individually and as part of a team.
